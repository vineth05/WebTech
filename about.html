       <a style="color:white;font-family:'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;"> Bringing Burj Khalifa to life required a combination of visionary ideals and solid science.
            In the process, the project amassed an awe-inspiring number of facts, figures, and statistics.

            Tallest of the Supertall

            Not only is Burj Khalifa the world's tallest building but it has also broken two other impressive records: tallest structure, previously held by the KVLY-TV mast in Blanchard, North Dakota, and tallest free-standing structure, previously held by Toronto's CN Tower. The Chicago-based Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat (CTBUH) has established 3 criteria to determine what makes a tall building tall. Burj Khalifa wins by far in all three categories.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Height to architectural top</b>
            </li>
            <p>
                Height is measured from the level of the lowest, significant, open-air, pedestrian entrance to the architectural top of the building. This includes spires but does not include antennae, signage, flagpoles or other functional-technical equipment. This measurement is the most widely used and is used to define the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat rankings of the Tallest Buildings in the World.
            </p>
            <li>
                <b>Highest occupied floor</b>
            </li>
            <p>
                Height is measured from the level of the lowest, significant, open-air, pedestrian entrance to the highest continually occupied floor within the building. Maintenance areas are not included.
            </p>
            <li>

                  Height to tip
                </b>
            </li>
            <p>
                Height is measured from the level of the lowest, significant, open-air, pedestrian entrance to the highest point of the building, irrespective of material or function of the highest element. This includes antennae, flagpoles, signage and other functional-technical equipment.
